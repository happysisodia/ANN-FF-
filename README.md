# ANN-FF-
I have implemented a Artificial neural network with back-propagation with learning rate and momentum


For this implementation, I have created a  2 layered feed forward neural network. Also due to the high dimentioanlity of the input data and data imbalance, I have applied SMOTE for balancing the dataset. 

This implementation is in python and only using basic toolboxes like numpy , math etc.
